    <div class = "a">Who Is She?</div>
    <div class="b">Well, She is an Android named Tara. Her function is to sing and change positions created by John Bregory and it costed $2000 to make, it didn't do much for except for singing lyrics and changing positions <a href = "https://in.images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=AwrPiBEBXkNg9BUAyUe7HAx.;_ylu=Y29sbwNzZzMEcG9zAzEEdnRpZAMEc2VjA3BpdnM-?p=tara+the+android&fr2=piv-web&fr=mcafee">(Image Of Tara)</a> </div>
    <div class="c">Info About The Video</div>
    <div class="d">On April 15,2009 a video named I feel Fantastic was posted on Youtube by the user CreepyBlog. His name is apparently John Bregory and made Tara in the 2006. It showed Tara singingI feel Fantastic, You feel Fantastic and please leave... run run run run repeatedetly. <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLy-AwdCOmI">(Link to the video)</a></div>
    <div class ="e">The Theory</div>    
    <div class = "f">Well, The theory says that John had believed that In ancient Greek mythology, Pygmalion was a highly accomplished Cypriot sculptor. Though skilled at imitating the human form, and well acquainted with it's subtleties, he became disgusted by it when he witnessed the Propoetides prostituting themselves. These women were punished by Venus for their lack of worship with a coarseness of skin and a crudeness of nature, and were then forced into prostitution. Seeing this, Pygmalion the sculptor was repelled and could no longer appreciate women.
Seemingly alone, Pygmalion sought to create for himself a perfect, pure, unsullied companion. He used his particular skills to this end: he created a statue bride.

What you are about to watch is a mysterious video. It's origin is attributed variously, and almost certainly spuriously, to various abstract artists or surrealists. The truth is that what we are seeing, and what we perceive to be strange and disturbing, is actually beauty to it's creator.
Perhaps what we are viewing is the work of a modern Pygmalion. To him, her toneless voice, the paleness of her skin and the comparative vibrancy of her lips may indeed be the very embodiment of a perfect woman...
Consider the mind-scape of the creator. In whose mind does this appear beautiful? In whose mind is this pure, near worshipful? Are we missing out on his perspective?

Who are we to be afraid or to judge them? He may well love her fully, perhaps more fully than any of us could ever hope to be loved. In the mind of her creator, she is a near goddess; the perfect representation, not just of femininity, but the peak of human potential. A perfectly satisfactory being.
